# App Store Deployment Agent Skill

Reduces App Store rejection risk by applying Apple's current review criteria (guidelines last updated **February 6, 2026**) to your submission before it reaches reviewers.

> **Skill content last reviewed: June 6, 2026.** Recent additions: Texas SB 2420 age assurance (live June 4, 2026), EU single-business-model fees (CTF→CTC, Jan 1, 2026), Australia/Vietnam age ratings (June 18, 2026). ⚠️ **WWDC 2026 runs June 8–12** — re-check Apple's developer news for a new Guidelines revision and SDK minimums after the keynote.

> **Authority hierarchy**: Apple's **App Review Guidelines** → **Program Requirements** (including Human Interface Guidelines and API docs incorporated into the [Apple Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/) — “ADPLA”) → Apple Support/Developer Docs → Apple WWDC transcripts → Community evidence (Reddit/StackOverflow/blogs).  
> When sources conflict, defer to the most recent Apple document. **Guidelines and ADPLA overlap but are not identical**: review can cite either; binary behavior must satisfy documented APIs, privacy rules, and contractual program requirements, not only guideline prose.

## Quick Approach

When invoked, run these gates in order — stop at the first blocker and fix it before continuing:

1. **Gate A – Hard submission blockers** (ITMS errors, missing manifests, broken URLs, **encryption/export**)
2. **Gate B – App completeness** (crashes, placeholders, missing demo access, broken IAPs)
3. **Gate C – Privacy & permissions** (policy, purpose strings, **location & ads**, ATT, account deletion)
4. **Gate D – Payments & monetization** (IAP rules, storefront scope, subscription UI)
5. **Gate E – Design & metadata** (4.2 minimum functionality, hidden features, spam, **IP & marks**)
6. **Gate F – Code execution & supply chain** (private APIs, hot updates, SDK manifests)
7. **Gate G – AI, UGC, and age gates** (disclosure, moderation, declared/verified age limits)
8. **Gate K – Safety, speech, gambling, sandbox & system access** (§1.1 violence/weapons, §5.3, containers vs privileged APIs)
9. **Gate H – Trust & anti-scam checks** (dark patterns, misleading pricing, manipulative flows)
10. **Gate I – Review operations & evidence** (reviewer-only bug logging, Resolution Center packets)
11. **Gate J – ADPLA & program requirements** (submission duties, TestFlight contract rules, restricted APIs/data uses called out in the license)

Then produce: **Submission readiness verdict → Reviewer path script → App Review Notes draft → escalation options**.

---

## Gate J — ADPLA & program requirements (contract + §3.3)

Use this gate when auditing **contractual** obligations and **Program Requirements** embedded in the ADPLA. These often align with App Review but can bite in legal, enterprise, or niche API cases.

**Submission & honesty (Agreement §6.1, §3.2(f))**
- Do **not** hide, misrepresent, or obscure features from review; you must cooperate with reasonable information requests.
- If the app **connects to a physical device** (including MFi accessories), **inform Apple in App Store Connect**: disclose the means of connection (e.g. BLE, Lightning, headphone jack, other protocol) and identify **at least one** physical device the app is designed to work with. Apple may request access or samples **at your expense** (samples may not be returned).
- Any post-submission change to functionality (including IAP-delivered functionality) generally requires **resubmission** for App Store / Custom App Distribution.

**Service providers (§2.9)**
- A third-party **may not** submit your app to the App Store or operate **TestFlight** on your behalf. (They may still host servers, etc., under a written agreement at least as protective of Apple as the ADPLA.)

**Certificates & signing (§5)**
- Safeguard distribution and submission certificates and keys; **do not** put App Store distribution certificates in shared cloud repos for third-party use. Notify Apple promptly if you believe keys are compromised (`product-security@apple.com`).

**Multi-platform visibility (§6.3, §6.4)**
- iOS/iPadOS apps submitted to the App Store may also be offered on **macOS** and **visionOS** via the App Store unless you **opt out** in App Store Connect — confirm rights, compatibility, and testing, or opt out.
- **CarPlay**: iOS app widgets may surface on CarPlay; use **`disfavorLocations`** when a widget is unsuitable for driving (e.g. heavy interaction, requires unlock).

**TestFlight — external testers (§6.5, §7.4)**
- **External** TestFlight distribution requires an **Apple-reviewed** build first. Updates with **significant changes** need re-review per App Store Connect process.
- **No fees** to participate in TestFlight; digital purchases in TestFlight builds must be **free** and for beta only.
- Prohibited: using TestFlight to **circumvent** the App Store, run perpetual demos, or **solicit App Store ratings**.
- **Kids-focused apps**: verify external beta testers meet **age of majority** in their jurisdiction.

**Operations & analytics (§6.7–6.8)**
- Data from Apple’s **developer analytics** is for **improving your apps** only — no handoff to third parties except a **Service Provider** under strict use limits; no cross-developer aggregation.
- Apps in the store must stay **compatible with the currently shipping OS**; Apple may remove apps that fall behind.

**Privacy & data — program text beyond typical guideline bullets**
- **Recordings** (camera, mic, screen, etc.): show a **clear, conspicuous** in-app indicator while recording; do not design for **secret** recording of others.
- **Sensitive Content Analysis**: do **not** send **off device** any signal about whether content was flagged as containing nudity.
- **Face Data**: use only for a **direct app purpose**; no advertising, authentication, or marketing; no selling to brokers; transfer off-device only with **clear consent** and for the stated function.
- **Health / HIPAA**: the ADPLA restricts using Apple Software/Services (including iCloud / CloudKit in scope of the terms) to create, store, or transmit **PHI** in ways that would make Apple your **business associate** — treat regulated health stacks as **legal + architecture** review, not checklist-only.
- **Declared Age Range / Significant App Update APIs**: use only for **age-appropriate features** or **legal** requirements; no selling that data to data brokers.
- **IDFA / AdSupport**: use only for **serving advertising**; honor **Tracking Preference**; after user resets the advertising identifier, do **not** link old and new IDs or derived data.

**In-App Purchase — Attachment 2 hooks**
- **Keyboard extensions** must **not** offer IAP **inside** the keyboard UI (IAP OK elsewhere in the host app).
- **US App Store storefront**: for **one-time** digital content IAP, before purchase you must clearly state the user is buying a **license**, with a link to full terms including **Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions** (and your EULA if applicable) — see Attachment 2 §3.2.

**Maps & Weather — required notice text (§3.3.3(F), WeatherKit Attachment 8)**
- **Real-time route / navigation** apps: EULA must include Apple’s required **“YOUR USE OF THIS REAL TIME ROUTE GUIDANCE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. LOCATION DATA MAY NOT BE ACCURATE.”** (exact wording per current ADPLA / docs).
- **Real-time weather guidance** via WeatherKit: EULA must include the **WeatherKit** disclaimer block required in Attachment 8 (accuracy / sole risk).

**Foundation Models (§3.3.8(I))**
- On-device / Apple Intelligence **Foundation Models** use is subject to Apple’s **[Foundation Models Framework Acceptable Use Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/acceptable-use-requirements-for-the-foundation-models-framework)**; keep **Adapters** compatible with the shipping model or risk OS incompatibility (§6.8).

**Regional addenda (verify current Apple Materials)**
- **Japan** — Alternative App Marketplaces, **Alternative Payment Processing**, and **Out-of-App Offers** have detailed design, entitlement, browser, prominence, age-gating, and reporting rules (**Attachment 12**). See [ADDENDUM.md — Japan ADPLA commerce](ADDENDUM.md#japan-app-store-adpla-attachment-12-commerce--distribution).
- **China mainland storefront** — **Attachment 13** amends **paid** commission rates (e.g. **25%** standard / **12%** small business and qualifying cases effective **March 15, 2026** per ADPLA text); confirm current Paid Applications Agreement for accounting.

**Notarization (macOS §5.3)**
- You may **not** tell users that Apple “approved” or “secured” your app because it was notarized; notarization is **not** a malware or safety guarantee from Apple’s perspective.

**EU — DSA & P2B (Schedule 1 Exhibit D)**
- Developers established in the EU can use Apple’s **DSA redress** information for account/app removal disputes: [apple.com/legal/dsa/redress-options](https://www.apple.com/legal/dsa/redress-options). **P2B** (platform-to-business) complaints for eligible regions: [developer.apple.com/contact/p2b](https://developer.apple.com/contact/p2b/).

**Illegal content & platform safety (§3.2(b))**  
- The ADPLA prohibits using Apple tools or services for unlawful activity or content — including material that **facilitates child sexual exploitation or abuse**. Such content is also a **hard rejection** under **Safety** guidelines (**§1.1**). Treat as **legal + safety + immediate removal** if ever implicated.

---

## Rejection Frequency (Apple 2024 — ~24.9% rejection rate)

Apple reviewed **7,771,599** submissions and rejected **~1,931,400** in 2024. A single rejection can cite multiple sections. Ranked by section prevalence:

| Rank | Section | Apple Anchor | Key Sublaws |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Performance** | §2.1 App Completeness | Crashes, placeholders, missing IAP, broken links |
| 2 | **Legal** | §5.1 Privacy | Policy missing, bad purpose strings, ATT, account deletion |
| 3 | **Design** | §4.2 / §4.3 | Minimum functionality, spam, copycats |
| 4 | **Business** | §3.1 Payments | IAP required, external links, subscription UI |
| 5 | **Safety** | §1.2 UGC | Missing moderation, report/block |
| — | **Technical** | §2.5.1/2.5.2 | Private APIs, code download, hot updates |

> Apple states: **"Over 40% of unresolved issues are related to Guideline 2.1: App Completeness."**  
> Source: [developer.apple.com/app-store/review](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/)

---

## Gate A — Hard Submission Blockers

These prevent even entering review. Fix before submitting.

**Minimum SDK requirement (deadline: April 28, 2026)**
- Apps uploaded to App Store Connect must be built with **Xcode 26 or later** using the **iOS 26 / iPadOS 26 / tvOS 26 / visionOS 26 / watchOS 26** SDK.
- Builds using older SDKs will be rejected at upload time.
- Reference: [Submitting apps](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/submitting/)

**Code signing & entitlements**
- Entitlements in the binary must match provisioning profile and App ID capabilities exactly.
- Common errors: `ITMS-90161` (invalid provisioning profile), `ITMS-9000` (invalid binary), entitlements mismatch.
- Fix: Regenerate profiles after adding/removing capabilities. Debug: `codesign -d --entitlements :- YourApp.app`.

**Launch screen storyboard (required since April 2020)**
- All iOS apps must include a LaunchScreen storyboard — apps without one are rejected.
- Xcode 16 bug: manually type the filename; verify `UILaunchStoryboardName` in Info.plist.

**Screenshot dimensions**
- Exact pixel dimensions required (1px off fails upload). Minimum: 6.7" (1290x2796) iPhone; 12.9" (2048x2732) iPad.
- Screenshots must reflect current build UI — outdated screenshots trigger §2.3.

**App size limits**
- iOS/visionOS: 4 GB max, __TEXT: 500 MB. watchOS: 75 MB hard limit.
- Cellular download: 200 MB default threshold — above requires Wi-Fi.
- Use Background Assets / On Demand Resources for large content.

**App Transport Security (ATS)**
- Global `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = YES` requires documented justification and may be rejected.
- Use domain-specific `NSExceptionDomains` instead. iOS 17+ has stricter IP-based restrictions.

**Privacy manifests — two separate obligations (both can block upload)**

1. **Third-party SDKs on Apple's list** — When you add or update an app that includes a listed binary SDK, that SDK must ship a valid `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` and (for binary deps) a valid signature. Common ITMS error: `ITMS-91061: Missing privacy manifest`.  
   - List (updates over time): [developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements](https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/)  
   - Fix: Upgrade the SDK; do **not** copy the vendor's data-collection story into your app's manifest as a substitute for their missing file (Apple expects the SDK bundle to carry its own manifest).

2. **Required reason APIs in *your* code** — If *your* app or any embedded executable uses Apple's "required reason" API categories (file timestamp, disk space, UserDefaults, system boot time, active keyboard, etc.), **your** app (or that executable's bundle) must declare approved reasons in `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` under `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes`. Starting **May 1, 2024**, apps without these declarations are not accepted. **Fingerprinting is never allowed**, regardless of user consent.  
   - Reference: [Describing use of required reason API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api)  
   - Xcode: **File → Project → Generate Privacy Report** aggregates SDK + app manifests.

**Broken required URLs**
- Support URL and Privacy Policy URL must return HTTP 200 at time of submission.
- Apple calls these out explicitly as common "unresolved issues."
- Fix: Run a URL health check script before every submission.

**Export compliance & encryption (upload + ADPLA)**
- If the app uses **encryption** (TLS, crypto libraries, proprietary crypto, etc.), set **`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`** in `Info.plist` accurately and complete the **encryption / export** questionnaire in App Store Connect. Without this, upload or distribution can stall until answered.
- **Scope is broad**: many apps answer “yes” because they use HTTPS or standard OS crypto; follow Apple’s wizard and docs for **exemptions** (e.g. only exempt categories).
- **Stronger cases**: custom crypto, VPN, secure messaging, or regulated markets may require **export classification** work (e.g. **EAR** / **BIS** self-classification or **CCATS** where applicable) and accurate **Schedule 1**–style certifications when you deliver binaries to Apple. Treat this as **legal + security**, not only a plist checkbox.
- **macOS notarization upload (§5.3)**: ADPLA prohibits uploading apps subject to certain **export-controlled** categories without authorization; align notarization payloads with your export story.
- Reference: [Complying with encryption export regulations](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/complying_with_encryption_export_regulations) · [App Store Connect — export compliance](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-information/export-compliance-documentation-for-encryption)

**Distribution scope & compliance (outside guideline text but blocks release)**
- **App Store** — Full [App Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/). Prep: [App Review](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/).
- **EU alternative marketplaces / Web Distribution / Japan marketplace** — Subset of guidelines + Notarization; use **Highlight Notarization Review Guidelines Only** in the guidelines UI. Still scanned for malware/safety. [Notarization (ASC)](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/managing-alternative-distribution/submit-for-notarization), [DMA & EU apps](https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/), [Web Distribution EU](https://developer.apple.com/support/web-distribution-eu/).
- **Mac App Store** — Extra rules in §2.4.5 (sandbox, no third-party installers, MAS-only updates). See [REFERENCE.md — Mac App Store](REFERENCE.md#mac-app-store-additional-rules-245).
- **EU DSA trader** — Traders distributing in the EU must complete verified contact display in App Store Connect (can block submission flow). [Manage EU DSA trader requirements](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-compliance-information/manage-european-union-digital-services-act-trader-requirements/).

---

## Gate B — App Completeness (§2.1)

The single largest rejection driver. Apple requires submissions be **"final versions."**

**Mandatory checklist:**
- [ ] App tested on physical device (not only Simulator) via TestFlight build
- [ ] Zero crashes on cold start, onboarding, login, core flows, and checkout
- [ ] No placeholder text ("Lorem ipsum"), empty screens, or stub features
- [ ] All in-app purchase products submitted with the binary and visible to reviewer
- [ ] Demo account provided (or Apple-approved demo mode): username, password, no 2FA blocking access, region matching reviewer environment
- [ ] Backend services live and accessible from outside your VPN/network
- [ ] Support URL and Privacy Policy URL are functional
- [ ] Notes for Review explain every non-obvious feature, IAP purchase path, and any hardware requirement

**IAP-specific "catch-22" loop (very common):**  
Products showing blank/missing pricing during review → rejected under 2.1(b). Fix: Submit IAPs together with the binary in App Store Connect. Ensure products are approved (not just created) before submitting the build.

**Receipt validation pattern that satisfies reviewers:**  
`/verifyReceipt` production first → if status 21007, fallback to sandbox. Apple's own rejection message text confirms this sequence.

**Reference:** [developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#app-completeness](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#app-completeness)  
**Community case:** RevenueCat ultimate guide — [revenuecat.com/blog/growth/the-ultimate-guide-to-app-store-rejections](https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/growth/the-ultimate-guide-to-app-store-rejections/)

---

## Gate C — Privacy & Permissions (§5.1)

Second-largest rejection bucket. Three artifacts must **agree**: privacy policy content, App Privacy nutrition label, and runtime behavior.

**Purpose strings — literal wording matters:**  
Bad: `"We need your location."`  
Good: `"Your location is used to show nearby coffee shops on the map."`  
Rejection message pattern: *"Your app requests access to [resource] but does not clearly explain why."*

**Account deletion — required since June 2022:**
- Must be in-app initiated (not email-only or support-ticket-only)
- Must delete account AND associated data (unless legally required to retain)
- Must be easy to find (Settings → [Account] → Delete Account)
- Reference: [developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app](https://developer.apple.com/support/offering-account-deletion-in-your-app/)

**Mandatory login gating rule:**
- If login is required, document in Notes for Review *why* the feature requires identity (cross-device state, progression, personalization)
- Allow guest/browse mode for features that don't need an account
- Rejection pattern: *"Your app requires users to log in before they can access features that are not account-based."*

**Third-party AI disclosure — explicit Apple requirement (§5.1.2(i)):**  
> *"You must clearly disclose where personal data will be shared with third parties, including with third-party AI, and obtain explicit permission before doing so."*

**Location services (§5.1.5 + ADPLA §3.3.3(F))**  
- Use **Core Location / MapKit / location-based** features only when **directly relevant** to what the app does.  
- **Do not** market or design for **autonomous vehicle control**, **emergency / life-saving** reliance, or other disallowed positioning (see guideline text and ADPLA for navigation/weather disclaimer requirements in **Gate J**).  
- **Notify and obtain consent** before collecting, transmitting, or using location; **purpose strings** and in-app explanations must match real use (**§5.1**).  
- **Do not** disable, spoof, or wrap Apple’s **system consent UI** for location (or contacts, photos, calendar, etc.) — accurate copy in permission dialogs only (**ADPLA §3.3.3(F)(iv)**).  
- **“Always” location**: provide a clear **user benefit** when requesting continuous access.  
- **Custom map overlays**: you are responsible for alignment and correctness when combining your data with **Apple Maps**.  
- Reference: [§5.1 Legal — Location Services](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#legal) · [HIG — accessing private data](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/patterns/accessing-private-data/)

**Advertising, tracking & identifiers**  
- **ATT** (`AppTrackingTransparency`): required for **cross-app / cross-site tracking** per Apple’s rules; cannot **gate core features** on tracking consent.  
- **IDFA / AdSupport (ADPLA §3.3.3(E))**: use **only** to **serve advertising**; check **Tracking Preference** before using IDFA for ads; after user **resets** the advertising identifier, do **not** link old and new IDs or derived data.  
- **Ad Network APIs** (if granted): use **only** for **ad validation / conversion** per Apple’s terms — no combining validation payloads with other user profiles.  
- **Kids Category**: **no** third-party analytics or third-party advertising in apps **primarily for kids** (**§1.3**); stricter rules for minors’ data.  
- **APNs / local notifications (Attachment 1)**: no **spam** or **phishing**; **promotional** push only with **explicit in-app opt-in** language and in-app **opt-out**, except Pass-related promotions tied to the Pass. Do not use notifications to **evade** privacy or tracking rules.  
- **Network Extension / “Access Wi‑Fi Info” (ADPLA §3.3.3(G))**: entitlements are for **networking functionality**, **not** ads, profiling, or bypassing user privacy settings (e.g. inferring location when location is off).  
- Reference: [§5.1 Privacy](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy) · [ATT](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apptrackingtransparency)

**Reference:** [developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#privacy)

## Gate D — Payments & Monetization (§3.1)

**Core IAP rule:** Unlocking features, subscriptions, in-game currency, premium content → **must use StoreKit IAP.** No QR codes, license keys, AR markers, or direct Stripe links (outside allowed exceptions).

**External purchase links — storefront-dependent (frequently misunderstood):**

| Storefront | External CTA allowed? | Entitlement needed? |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| United States | Yes | No (as of current guidelines) |
| EU (iOS/iPadOS) | With StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement | Yes |
| Japan (Japan App Store storefront) | **Alternative Payment Processing** and/or **Out-of-App Offers** only with Apple-granted entitlement + **StoreKit** eligibility/disclosure flows; see ADPLA **Attachment 12** and Apple Materials | Yes |
| Netherlands dating apps | With specific entitlement | Yes |
| South Korea | With StoreKit External Purchase Entitlement | Yes |
| All others | No | N/A |

**Japan (Attachment 12) — design rules that differ from “US-style” external links:** IAP must be offered **at least as prominently** as any alternative payment option on the same screen; **Out-of-App** purchases use an **actionable link** that opens the **default web browser** (not an in-app `WKWebView`); no website-purchase promo on the **App Store product page**; **Kids** category and age rules block certain offers; entitlement/device OS requirements are defined in Apple Materials (ADPLA references **iOS 26.2+**, Japan devices). Full checklist: [ADDENDUM.md](ADDENDUM.md#japan-app-store-adpla-attachment-12-commerce--distribution).

**Subscription paywall — minimum required disclosures:**
- Subscription price and billing period must be **prominent and legible**
- The **amount actually billed** must be the most prominent pricing element in the layout
- Auto-renewal must be disclosed
- "Cancel anytime" text cannot be the only subscription info shown
- "Restore Purchases" button required
- Trial period terms must be shown before purchase
- Sign-up screen should include subscription name/duration and the service/content provided

**Rejection pattern:** App Review uses §3.1.2 as a catch-all for paywall design problems. If price/period aren't prominent enough → increase contrast and font size.

**B2B SaaS edge case:** Even if your app serves enterprise customers who purchased on the web, in-app digital access (features, content, subscriptions) still requires IAP unless the app qualifies as "multiplatform service" or "enterprise service" under §3.1.3.

**Reference:** [developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments)

---

## Gate E — Design & Metadata (§4.2, §2.3)

**Minimum Functionality (§4.2):** App must "elevate beyond a repackaged website."  
Red flags: WebView as primary experience, app equivalent to browsing a URL, no offline/native value, marketing-only content.  
Fix: Add meaningful native features — device sensors, push notifications, offline mode, native navigation, deep linking.

**Hidden features (§2.3.1):** Any feature reachable via deep link, debug gesture, or feature flag that reviewers can't discover through normal use = hidden feature = rejection.  
Fix: Document every non-obvious feature path in Notes for Review with specificity.

**Spam (§4.3):** Multiple Bundle IDs for near-identical apps (different regions/teams/languages) = removal risk.  
Fix: One app with in-app variations or in-app purchase.

**Copycats (§4.1):** Closely mirroring another app's icon, name, or UI = rejection + potential expulsion.

**Intellectual property, Apple marks & third-party brands (§5.2, ADPLA §3.1(d), §3.3.4)**  
- You **certify** under the ADPLA that the app, **App Store metadata** (screenshots, description, previews, icons), **Xcode Cloud** content you provide, and **Wallet Pass** materials do **not** infringe **Apple’s or anyone else’s** rights — including **copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, right of publicity, music / performance / sync licenses, video and stock-photo rights, fonts, and third-party data / API terms**.  
- **App content**: only assets **you own** or **properly license** (including user-generated or partner content you display).  
- **Third-party logos / names** in UI, notifications, passes, or marketing: use only with **permission** and in ways that **don’t imply endorsement** or confuse origin (**§5.2**, **§5.2.4**).  
- **Apple marks & product imagery** (App Store logo, iPhone silhouettes, “Compatible with…,” **Apple Pay** marks, **Wallet** badges, screenshots of Apple UI): follow Apple’s **written** marketing and identity rules — not informal reuse. Primary entry points:  
  - [Marketing Resources and Identity Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/)  
  - [Guidelines for Using Apple Trademarks and Copyrights](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html) (also cited in ADPLA **§2.6** for referencing Apple products)  
  - [Apple Pay Marketing Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/apple-pay/marketing/) · [Add to Apple Wallet Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/wallet/add-to-apple-wallet-guidelines/)  
- **§5.2.1–5.2.3**: no **protected third-party material** without permission; no **misleading or copycat** representations; honor **third-party service terms** if you access or monetize their content; do not facilitate **illegal file sharing** or unauthorized **download/save** of media from third-party sources (e.g. streaming services) unless expressly permitted.  
- **§5.2.4 Apple endorsements**: do **not** suggest or imply Apple **supplies**, **endorses**, or **guarantees** your app’s quality. **“Editor’s Choice”** (and similar) badges are **applied only by Apple**.  
- **§5.2.5 Apple products**: do not make an app **confusingly similar** to Apple’s **products, interfaces, App Store / iTunes / Messages**, or **Apple ads** — includes look-and-feel that mimics system or store UI.  
- **Disputes**: third-party IP claims against your app are handled via Apple’s [IP dispute process](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/dispute-forms/index.html) when applicable.  
- **Safari / Website Push IDs (ADPLA Attachment 1 §3)**: notifications must be sent under **your** site’s **name and brand**; include **your** icon / logo / identifying mark; **do not impersonate** another site or mislead about the sender. If you reference a **third-party** trademark in a push, you **warrant** you have the **rights**. Enabling Website Push permits Apple to use **screenshots** of those notifications and **your** associated marks in **Apple marketing**, except portions you **identify in writing** as not cleared for promotion.  
- **In-app Apple services** (e.g. **MusicKit**, **ShazamKit**): follow **Apple Music Identity Guidelines** and program docs — artwork and metadata often **cannot** be split from permitted playback/UI patterns.  
- Reference: [§5.2 Intellectual Property](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#legal) (scroll **Legal** section)

**App Clips / Widgets / Extensions (often overlooked):**
- App Clips cannot include advertising.
- Widgets, extensions, and notifications must be directly related to app content/functionality.
- Siri intents must match what the app actually does; avoid registering irrelevant intents.

**Reference:** [developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#minimum-functionality) · [Legal (IP, location)](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#legal)

---

## Gate F — Code Execution & Supply Chain (§2.5)

**No code download that changes functionality (§2.5.2):**
- Hot-update frameworks (JSPatch, Rollout, code-push patterns) that modify production JS bundles → rejected
- Rejection message: *"Your app downloads, installs, or executes code that introduces or changes features or functionality."*
- Allowed: Content/config updates that don't add new executable behavior
- Allowed narrow exception: Educational apps where code is user-viewable and user-editable
- Community fix for React Native: Remove or lock hot-update path; ensure release builds don't include dev server URLs

**Private APIs (§2.5.1):**
- `prefs:root://` and similar Settings deep links are private / unsupported → rejection risk. Prefer opening the app's settings page via `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString` (or SwiftUI `openSettingsURLString`) so the user lands in **your** app's settings, not arbitrary system panes.
- Private selectors / SPI in your code or in a dependency → automated rejection. Audit with `strings` / static analysis; update or replace SDKs that embed private symbols (IOKit private I/O, undocumented SpringBoard APIs, etc.).
- StackOverflow pattern: private IOKit or entitlement misuse flagged; fix by updating/removing the offending SDK or code path.

## Gate G — AI Features, UGC, and Age Gates (§1.2, §4.7, §5.1.2)

**If your app has AI-generated content visible to users:**
- Treat it as UGC: must have report/block/filter mechanisms (§1.2)
- Must have published contact information
- If AI can produce NSFW content, hide by default and only enable via website-side control

**If AI inference is server-side:**
- User data sent off-device → must appear in App Privacy answers and privacy policy
- If a third-party AI provider receives personal data → explicit disclosure + consent required (§5.1.2(i))

**"Coding assistant" apps / LLM code generation — §2.5.2 interpretation:**
- Generating code that the user views/edits (educational exception) = generally OK
- Downloading and executing new code that changes the app's own behavior = rejected
- Mini-apps, chatbots, plug-ins under §4.7 are allowed but require full §5.1 and §1.2 compliance

**Kids Category + AI:** Zero third-party analytics/advertising. AI features that could expose kids to inappropriate content are especially scrutinized.

**Creator apps / age-gated content:** If the app allows creation or discovery of content that can exceed the app's age rating, require a way to flag that content and restrict access using verified or declared age. Keep **App Store Connect age rating** answers current with the [2026 age rating system](https://developer.apple.com/news/upcoming-requirements/?id=07242025a) and [definitions](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/age-ratings-values-and-definitions/).

**Multi-platform targets (tvOS, watchOS, visionOS):** Privacy manifests and required-reason API rules apply per Apple docs across these platforms; validate each target's `Info.plist`, extensions, widgets, and embedded binaries separately.

## Gate K — Safety, speech, gambling, sandbox & system access

**Apple anchors:** [Safety (§1.x)](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#safety) · [Legal — §5.3 Gaming / gambling](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#legal) · [Software requirements / sandbox expectations](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#software-requirements)  
**Deeper dives:** [REFERENCE.md — Gaming & gambling](REFERENCE.md#gaming-gambling-and-lotteries-53) · [EDGE-CASES — Content policy](EDGE-CASES.md#content-policy-edge-cases)

### Violence, weapons & objectionable content (§1.1)

- Apple rejects **offensive, gratuitous, or harmful** content — including realistic **killing, torture, or abuse** of people or animals when presented to **shock** or **glorify** harm (see full **§1.1** text for examples and nuance).
- **§1.1.3 — Weapons:** Apps must not **encourage illegal or reckless** use of weapons/dangerous objects or **facilitate purchase** of **firearms/ammunition** where the guideline prohibits it. Hunting/sport contexts still need **appropriate age rating** and compliance with local law.
- **Games:** Fictional “enemies” must not **solely target** a **real** race, culture, government, corporation, or other real-world group (**§1.1.2**).
- **Terrorism / serious harm:** Content that **threatens, incites, or promotes violence** or **CSAM** is prohibited under guidelines and **ADPLA §3.2(b)** — immediate legal/safety escalation, not a routine review tweak.

### “Open speech,” politics, satire & forums

- The App Store is a **private platform**: Apple enforces **§1.1** (e.g. hate, harassment, defamation) and local-law-sensitive material. **First Amendment / “free speech”** doctrines **do not** bind Apple’s acceptance of your app.
- **§1.1.1** explicitly notes that **professional political satirists and humorists** are **generally exempt** from a narrow part of the objectionable-content rule — **satire used as cover for harassment** or **defamation** still fails review.
- **UGC / social / debate apps:** You still need **§1.2** tooling (filter, report, block, contact, timely response) and **age-appropriate** controls; “open discussion” is not a bypass for **illegal** content or **missing moderation**.

### Gambling, contests & loot boxes (§5.3 + §3.1.1)

- **Real-money gaming** (sportsbook, casino, poker, etc.): **licensing** in every jurisdiction you ship; **geo-restrict** to licensed regions; app must be **free to download**; **no IAP** to purchase **gambling credits** (**§5.3**). Expect **extra review** time.
- **Sweepstakes / contests:** Must be **run by you**; **official rules** in-app must state **Apple is not a sponsor** (**§5.3.1–5.3.2**).
- **Loot boxes / randomized digital items:** Disclose **odds** of item types **before purchase** (**§3.1.1**).
- **Gray areas** (skill contests, fantasy, prediction markets): **legal review** per territory — see [EDGE-CASES — Gambling gray zone](EDGE-CASES.md#gambling-gray-zone).

### Sandboxing, containers & “system access”

- **iOS / iPadOS / tvOS / watchOS / visionOS:** Apps must stay within Apple’s **documented** model: your **sandbox / designated container**, **extensions** only in **documented** surfaces, **no private APIs** to poke other apps’ data or system internals (**§2.5.1**, **ADPLA §3.3.1**). Use **public** APIs for sharing (share sheet, `UIDocumentPicker`, App Groups where appropriate, etc.).
- **Mac App Store:** **Sandbox required** per **§2.4.5** — no third-party installers, no escaping the store for updates, no **root/setuid** — see [REFERENCE.md — Mac App Store](REFERENCE.md#mac-app-store-additional-rules-245).
- **Privileged capabilities** (examples): **VPN** (**§5.4** — org account, `NEVPNManager`, strict no-resale-of-user-data), **MDM** (**§5.5** — enterprise/gov/edu patterns, Apple approval), **Network Extension** (declared networking purpose only; see **Gate C**). Misusing these for **surveillance**, **ads**, or **undeclared** data collection → rejection and program risk.
- **Settings / system UI:** Do not deep-link into arbitrary **Settings** panes with **private URL schemes** (`prefs:root`, etc.); open **your app’s** settings via **`openSettingsURLString`** (**Gate F**).
- **macOS “power user” APIs** (Accessibility, Automation, screen capture, input monitoring): Use **only** for **stated, legitimate** features; reviewers may flag **Automation** or **Accessibility** used to **control other apps** for non–a11y purposes. Document the **user-visible** purpose in **Notes for Review** and match **entitlements** to reality.

## Gate H — Trust, Dark Patterns, and Anti-Scam Enforcement (§3.1.2, §5.6)

Apple increasingly enforces **customer trust**, not just technical compliance.

**High-risk patterns:**
- Misleading trial emphasis where the billed amount is visually subordinate
- Subscription flows that obscure renewal price, duration, or cancellation
- Forcing reviews, downloads, contact uploads, tracking permission, or other store-related actions to unlock access
- Charging for built-in OS capabilities like push notifications, camera access, or iCloud storage
- Manipulative wording, false scarcity, bait-and-switch pricing, or features promised but not delivered

## Gate I — Review Operations & Evidence

Use this when the issue only reproduces in App Review but not internally.

**Reviewer-only issue playbook (high success rate):**
- Add temporary structured diagnostics for login, paywall load, and API error paths.
- Log non-PII correlation data: build number, timestamp, endpoint, status code, device model/OS if available.
- Correlate logs with App Review rejection timestamp and attach findings in Resolution Center.
- Include screenshot/video and exact repro path in your response packet.

**Why this matters:** a frequent rejection loop is \"can't log in / can't proceed\" that cannot be reproduced by internal testers. Evidence-backed replies reduce back-and-forth and unblock review faster.

**Operational reminders from Apple guidance:**
- Repeated rejections for the same issue can slow review.
- Metadata-only rejections can often be fixed and resubmitted without a new binary.

## Reviewer Path Script Template

Produce this for every submission. Fill in all `[brackets]`.

```
App Review Notes

App concept: [1-2 sentence description of what the app does and for whom]

Demo account:
  Username: [email or username]
  Password: [password]
  Region/storefront: [e.g. United States]
  Notes: [any pre-seeded data the reviewer needs to see, no 2FA active]

Key feature walkthrough:
  1. [Step to reach Feature A — required for reviewer to find it]
  2. [Step to trigger in-app purchase paywall — exact tap path]
  3. [Step to find account deletion — Settings → Profile → Delete Account]
  4. [Step to access AI feature, if present]

Backend: Live and accessible. No VPN required.

In-app purchases: [List product IDs submitted with this binary]

Non-obvious behaviors: [Anything that might look like a bug but is intentional]

Hardware (if any): [Connection type + device name; confirm App Store Connect §6.1 disclosure matches]

Attachment: [demo video URL or note if hardware is required]
```

## After Rejection: Resolution Loop

```
Rejected → Read guideline clause cited exactly
         → Reproduce on a TestFlight build on real device
         → Classify: metadata-only fix OR requires new binary?
         → Metadata only: fix + reply in Resolution Center (no new binary needed)
         → New binary: fix code → QA → upload new build → reply with notes
         → Disagree: submit ONE appeal per rejected submission via App Store Connect
         → Appeal upheld: resolved
         → Appeal denied: fix per guidelines and resubmit
```

**Appeal tips (from Apple's own guidance):**
- Cite the exact guideline clause and explain compliance specifically
- Do not submit multiple appeals for the same rejection
- Bug-fix-only submissions for live apps can bypass some violations (except legal/safety)
- You can attach screenshots, demo videos, and supporting documents until you resubmit
- If only part of a multi-item submission is rejected, you can remove rejected items and continue with accepted ones
- Apple offers App Review appointments for pre-review/process guidance on difficult submissions
