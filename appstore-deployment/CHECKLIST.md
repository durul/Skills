- [ ] **Required reason APIs** — If app or embedded targets use covered APIs (disk space, file timestamps, UserDefaults, boot time, active keyboard, etc.), `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` on **that target** includes `NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes` with [approved reasons](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api)
- [ ] **App Store Connect → Validate App** (or upload dry-run) — no privacy-manifest or signature errors reported
- [ ] **EU DSA** — Trader status and verified contact flow completed if distributing in the EU as a trader; hobbyist/non-trader path declared if applicable ([ASC Help](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/manage-compliance-information/manage-european-union-digital-services-act-trader-requirements/))
- [ ] Export compliance set in Info.plist (`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption`) and ASC encryption questions completed; if app uses non-exempt crypto, legal/export classification path reviewed (EAR/BIS/CCATS as applicable)
- [ ] App not using `UIWebView` (deprecated; use `WKWebView`)
- [ ] No private Settings URL schemes (`prefs:root`, `App-Prefs`, etc.) — use `UIApplication.openSettingsURLString` for your app's settings

- [ ] No charging for built-in OS capabilities (push notifications, iCloud storage, camera)
- [ ] No fake scarcity, misleading countdowns, or visually deceptive trial emphasis

### Gate E — Design & Metadata

- [ ] **Age rating questionnaire** in App Store Connect matches real content (recheck after adding social, UGC, or creator tools)
- [ ] Primary flows pass a **VoiceOver** smoke test (labels, focus order)
- [ ] Screenshots match current build's actual UI
- [ ] App description matches current features (no removed features still advertised)
- [ ] "What's New" is specific (not "bug fixes and performance improvements")
- [ ] App is not a thin WebView wrapper without native functionality
- [ ] No multiple Bundle IDs for near-identical apps (**§4.3(a)**)
- [ ] **§4.3(b) saturated categories** (dating, flashlight, sound effects, wallpaper, simple timer, fortune telling): app offers a *meaningfully different or improved* experience; differentiation case documented in Notes for Review (June 2026 — Apple may also remove stale/unsuccessful apps in these categories)
- [ ] **§4.3(b) low-effort categories** (drinking games, Kama Sutra, fart, burp): not submitting — repeated submissions risk Apple Developer Program removal (June 2026)
- [ ] **IP clearance**: app binary + screenshots + previews + description + icon: you own or license all content (audio, video, images, fonts, data feeds, third-party logos); no false **Apple endorsement** (**§5.2.4**)
- [ ] **Apple marks / Apple Pay / Wallet / “Compatible with”**: comply with [App Store marketing guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/), [Apple trademark guidelines](https://www.apple.com/legal/intellectual-property/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html), and product-specific guides (Apple Pay, Wallet) where applicable

- [ ] All features accessible via normal navigation (no hidden features)
- [ ] New features documented in Notes for Review with navigation path
- [ ] App Clip (if present) contains no advertising
- [ ] Widgets/extensions/notifications are related to app functionality
- [ ] Siri intents/Shortcuts registered only for tasks the app actually performs

### Gate F — Code Execution

- [ ] No hot-update frameworks downloading new executable code
- [ ] React Native/Expo: OTA updates do not change functionality post-review
- [ ] No `eval()` of remotely fetched code
- [ ] Feature flags only show/hide existing features (don't introduce new code paths)
- [ ] Educational code sandbox: code is user-viewable and user-editable per §2.5.2 exception

### Mac App Store only (if distributing on MAS)

- [ ] Sandboxed per §2.4.5; no third-party installer
- [ ] No license-key or license screen at launch; updates only via Mac App Store
- [ ] No Sparkle or other external updater bundled in the MAS build
- [ ] No auto-login items / background daemons without explicit user consent

### Gate K — Safety, gambling, speech & system access

- [ ] **§1.1**: No prohibited violence/weapons facilitation; game enemies are not solely real-world targeted groups; age rating matches graphic content
- [ ] **§5.3**: If real-money gambling: licensed + geo-gated + free app + no IAP for gambling credits; sweepstakes rules say Apple is not a sponsor
- [ ] **Loot boxes / gacha**: Odds disclosed before purchase (**§3.1.1**)
- [ ] **Speech / forums / satire**: Understand Apple is not a “free speech” forum; satire apps align with **§1.1.1** professional exemption; UGC still has **§1.2** moderation
- [ ] **Sandbox**: iOS app respects container / documented APIs; Mac App Store build is sandboxed (**§2.4.5**); no `prefs:root` / private Settings URLs
- [ ] **VPN / MDM / Network Extension**: Meets **§5.4 / §5.5** (org account, disclosures, NEVPNManager for VPN); entitlements match declared behavior

### Gate G — AI & UGC

- [ ] AI features: user consent obtained before sending personal data to third-party AI
- [ ] AI-generated user-visible content: report, block, filter mechanisms present
- [ ] UGC moderation: filter, report (with timely response), block, contact info — all four present
- [ ] UGC takedown operations active: violating content (incl. pornographic) is actually removed, and a **written compliance plan** can be produced if Apple asks (**§1.2**, June 2026)
- [ ] NSFW content: hidden by default; enable toggle only available on your website (not in-app)
- [ ] Kids Category: no third-party analytics, no third-party advertising, no tracking identifiers
- [ ] If the app is a creator / AI content app, age-rating answers in App Store Connect were re-reviewed for 2026 updates
- [ ] If content can exceed the app age rating, underage access is restricted using declared or verified age

### Gate H — Trust / Anti-Scam

- [ ] No forced rating/review prompts to unlock access
- [ ] No forced downloads of other apps or social-posting tasks to unlock access
- [ ] No permissions gated as a condition of use when the feature can degrade gracefully
- [ ] No misleading copy around pricing, discounts, urgency, or trial conversion
- [ ] No claims in marketing/screenshots that the app cannot substantiate in the reviewed build
- [ ] The submitting entity clearly matches the regulated service provider, if applicable

### Gate I — Review Operations & Evidence

- [ ] Resolution Center packet prepared: issue clause + repro steps + fix summary
- [ ] Reviewer-only diagnostics enabled for auth/IAP/network failures (non-PII)
- [ ] Correlation IDs included in backend logs for review build requests
- [ ] Screenshots/video attachment prepared for non-obvious or hardware-specific flows
- [ ] If rejection is metadata-only, plan same-build resubmission path
- [ ] If appealing, draft one evidence-based appeal (one per rejected submission)

### Gate J — ADPLA / program requirements (contract)

- [ ] **Hardware disclosure**: If the app pairs with or controls a **physical device** (including MFi), App Store Connect notes / submission fields document **connection type** and **at least one** supported device (per ADPLA §6.1)
- [ ] **No hidden functionality**: Everything reviewers need is reachable from normal UI or clearly documented in Notes for Review
- [ ] **TestFlight**: External testers only after Apple-approved build; no paid beta; no using TestFlight to dodge App Store or harvest ratings (§7.4)
- [ ] **Service providers**: Nobody outside your team submits the app or runs TestFlight **on your behalf** (§2.9)
- [ ] **Certificates**: Distribution/signing keys not shared via public cloud for third-party signing; compromise → notify Apple (`product-security@apple.com`)
- [ ] **Recording / Sensitive Content Analysis**: Obvious **recording** indicator when capturing mic/camera/screen; **no** uploading off-device flags that Sensitive Content Analysis found nudity (§3.3.3)
- [ ] **Real-time nav / WeatherKit**: EULA includes required **disclaimer** strings if the app qualifies (ADPLA §3.3.3(F), WeatherKit Attachment 8)
- [ ] **US one-time digital IAP**: Pre-purchase **license** disclosure + link to **Apple Media Services** terms where required (Attachment 2 §3.2)
- [ ] **Japan storefront**: If using **Alternative Payment Processing** / **Out-of-App Offers**, entitlement + **StoreKit** flows + **default browser** (not web view) for outbound purchases — see ADDENDUM.md Japan section
- [ ] **macOS notarization**: Marketing does **not** claim Apple “approved” or “verified security” of the app (§5.3)
- [ ] **ADPLA §3.1(d)**: To best of your knowledge, metadata and app do not infringe Apple or third-party IP (including music, video, photography, logos, data rights)

Thank you for reviewing [App Name].

We've addressed the issue you identified:

[Specific issue]: [Specific fix applied]

The demo account credentials in the App Review Information section have been 
verified and allow full access to all features including [specific feature].

The in-app purchases are now submitted alongside this build in "Ready to Submit" 
state and should be visible to reviewers.

Navigation path to reach [specific feature]:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Result]

We've resubmitted the build with these changes and look forward to your review.
```

### Template B — Privacy/Permission Response

```
Thank you for your review of [App Name].

Regarding Guideline 5.1.1: [Specific concern]

We have made the following changes:
1. [Updated privacy policy URL to: https://yourapp.com/privacy]
2. [Added accessible privacy policy link in app: Settings → Privacy Policy]
3. [Updated purpose string for [permission] to clearly state: "[new string]"]
4. [Added account deletion at: Settings → Account → Delete Account]

The purpose string for [permission] now reads:
"[Exact new purpose string that clearly explains user benefit]"

Our privacy policy at [URL] now explicitly covers:
- Data collected: [list]
- Data not collected: [list]  
- Third parties: [list, or "None"]

We believe these changes fully address the concern raised.
```

### Template C — Payments/IAP Response

```
Thank you for reviewing [App Name].

Regarding Guideline 3.1.1: [Specific concern]

[App Name] is a [multiplatform service / enterprise service / free companion app] 
that [describe qualifying category].

[Choose applicable]:

OPTION A (multiplatform service):
Users subscribe via our website and receive access across all platforms including 
iOS, Android, and web. The iOS app provides access to content users have already 
purchased on other platforms. We do not include any call-to-action directing users 
to purchase in the app. This qualifies as a multiplatform service per §3.1.3(b).

OPTION B (free companion app):
The iOS app is entirely free and serves as a companion to our web platform. Users 
manage their subscription on the web. We have removed any reference to pricing or 
external purchase within the app binary. This qualifies per §3.1.3(f).

OPTION C (IAP added):
We have implemented StoreKit in-app purchase for [feature/subscription]. The 
paywall is now accessible at [path] and products are submitted with this build.
```

### Template D — Metadata/Hidden Features Response

```
Thank you for reviewing [App Name].

Regarding Guideline 2.3.1:

We have updated the Notes for Review with complete documentation of all features:

[Feature that was flagged]:
- Purpose: [explanation]
- How to access: [exact navigation path]
- Why it exists: [user benefit]
- It is NOT a hidden feature; it is accessible via [path] and documented in 
  the app's [Help section / Onboarding / Settings]

We have also updated [screenshots/description] to reflect [specific change].

The updated Notes for Review with complete feature documentation are attached 
to this submission.
```

### Template E — Trust / Manipulative Practices Response

```
Thank you for the review of [App Name].

Regarding the concern under [Guideline 3.1.2 / 5.6 / 3.2.2]:

We have revised the affected flow to remove any potentially misleading or 
manipulative elements:

1. [Example: The billed amount is now the most prominent pricing element]
2. [Example: We removed countdown copy that could imply false scarcity]
3. [Example: We added a clear Restore Purchases / Manage Subscription path]
4. [Example: We removed any requirement to rate the app or enable tracking]

The updated flow can be reviewed at:
[exact navigation path]

We believe these changes address the customer-trust concern raised in review.
```

### Template E — Reviewer-Only Login/Purchase Failure Response

```
Thank you for the review and for flagging this issue.

We investigated this in the review build and added temporary diagnostics to
capture the exact failure path. We identified the issue as:
[e.g., token refresh failure on first login / regional backend route mismatch /
IAP product state mismatch].

Fix applied:
1. [Specific code or backend fix]
2. [Any config/environment fix]
3. [Validation performed on physical TestFlight devices]

To verify in this submission:
1. [Exact path]
2. [Expected result]

We also attached [screenshot/video] and updated App Review Notes with the
exact walkthrough.
```
